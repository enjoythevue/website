  Welcome to Enjoy the Vue! Today we’re here to talk about this mythical thing
  called “Work/Life Balance.” We talk about our relationship to development
  right now and its impact on our life. The topic of work hard mentality and
  imposter syndrome is discussed, especially with developers around the world.
  The discussion turns deeper about making time to do other things that are
  important to you, outside of work. Also, we discuss our work life development,
  if we are happy, or if there are any changes we want to make. By the end, we
  hope you'll find some words of inspiration.
