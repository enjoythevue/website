  The increasing volume of the societal discussion on mental health is blooming
  into a variety of results. One of the interesting aspects of these
  developments are apps aimed at helping users with their self-care and mental
  health management and, today, we have a conversation about a new mobile app
  called Whimser, which is doing exactly that! We are joined by their founder
  and CTO, Rahat Chowdhury, who speaks to us about the startup, its roots in CBT
  or cognitive behavioral therapy, and how they approach using journaling to
  combat negative thought patterns and cognitive distortions. Rahat explains how
  the application is not designed as a replacement for therapy but rather as a
  tool to enhance practices that users already have in place, offering
  continuity and opportunities for further reflection. Rahat also explains a
  little bit about how the company is currently being run and the leadership
  philosophies that ground what they do. He strongly believes in bringing a
  human element into the work, and shares the interesting decision to bring in
  junior developers from the get-go and the motivations behind this. For this
  fascinating conversation with an inspiring young founder and developer doing
  important and conscientious work, make sure to tune in!

  “We do stuff like having some natural language processing in the background that helps you categorize your thoughts into what could be potential cognitive distortions to help you set yourself up to figure out how to combat those thoughts.” — [@Rahatcodes](https://twitter.com/Rahatcodes) \[0:02:14]


  “Trying to create a better atmosphere or a better community around tech will definitely help out in fighting imposter syndrome.” — [@Rahatcodes](https://twitter.com/Rahatcodes) \[0:06:37]


  “Whimser started from when I started taking better care of my own mental health. I started going to therapy and treating my depression, and a few other things.” — [@Rahatcodes](https://twitter.com/Rahatcodes) \[0:09:46]
