  There are so many tools out there that can make your life as a developer
  easier or more fun. In today’s episode, Alex, Tessa, and Ari sit down to share
  some of their favorite tools. We hear about why everyone loves VSCode and find
  out the story of how each panelist came to use this editor for their work. We
  also dive into themes, terminals, and font choices, where there are some
  seriously hot takes. In fact, Alex has such hot takes, we are not even sure he
  will be a host anymore! Our conversation even gets into mouse selection,
  keyboard choice, where you hear about what a hot-swappable keyboard is, and
  some of the best extensions for typos. Ultimately, you have to decide what
  makes your life better and improves your workflow. We are just here to share
  what works for us. Tune in to hear it all!

  “What makes VS Code so powerful is its plugins. You can turn VS Code into an IDE, which is an integrated development environment. That allows you to have your debugging built-in.” —[@fimion](https://twitter.com/fimion) \[0:04:40]


  “My random, other extra dev thing is that I use a gaming mouse.” — [@GloomyLumi](https://twitter.com/gloomylumi?lang=en) \[0:31:41]


  “I feel like, if you have a mouse you take that opportunity to try a new mouse, because usually, you don't really have that option.” — Tessa \[0:37:07]


  “Hot swappable boards are solderless. You just pop the switches up, pop in new ones, but you have to have something in the board to hold the switch in place.” —[@fimion](https://twitter.com/fimion) \[0:40:54]
