shownotes: >-
  Our discussion today is focused on Rust and why you may want to explore this
  popular language. Here to help us get into the subject is Matan Kushner, who
  is a developer at CodeSandbox, while also working on AniList and Starship! We
  start off our chat taking a survey of the panel's back-end experience before
  Matan broaches the topic of Rust and why he initially dedicated the time to
  learn it. Our guest explains why he values the language and the fail-safe type
  features of the strict compiler, which allow a lot more peace of mind around
  shipping. We also get to hear from Matan about the best ways to go about
  learning Rust and the benefits of having a singular source of knowledge to
  this end. We also find time to discuss the community attached to Rust, how
  Matan uses it in his different endeavors, and how the language can be used for
  in-browser development. We round out the episode with some colorful picks that
  might excite you, so for all this and a whole lot more fun conversation, join
  us on Enjoy the Vue!

  “I particularly have been working a lot on back-end, though my history lies primarily with front-end. This is my first full-time job, where back-end was a real responsibility.” — [@matchai](https://twitter.com/matchai) \[0:03:05]


  “Rust makes it, so that you can have both very, very fast, low-level processing, while having the guarantees that exist in higher level languages, like JavaScript.” — [@matchai](https://twitter.com/matchai) \[0:05:09]


  “I personally picked up Rust in an effort to build Starship, which is, it's an open source project of mine.” — [@matchai](https://twitter.com/matchai) \[0:07:32]


  “It is a very strict language, but in all the best ways. You can't run into impossible states. You can't run into unaccounted errors. Rust will tell you at compile time, if any possible error state can happen, which makes you very confident in the code you ship.” — [@matchai](https://twitter.com/matchai) \[0:09:45]
