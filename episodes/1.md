And today and our panel we have Elizabeth Fine. \n\nElizabeth: Hey, everyone. \n\nChris: Ari Clark.\n\nAri: 'Sup benches!\n\nChris: and Ben Hong. \n\nBen: Hello hello!\n\nChris: Great. So this is episode numero Uno, as they say in the biz, and also like in Spanish speaking countries, but with a better accent. And this is a new podcast. We were previously hosts on Views on Vue, and we're starting a new podcast. You know, if you are a listener of Views on Vue and are joining us here, Glad to have you back. You know, we've had a little bit of a hiatus as we've been trying to get this new podcast up and running, and we're really excited to bring you this new podcast with panel discussions, guest interviews, and much more to keep you up to date on what's happening in the Vue and tech communities. So in this first episode, what we wanted to do is is not cover too much like tech stuff, but just introduce the panel and the show and give people sort of, ah, a little bit of idea of what we're doing here. So let's first go around. And you know once again, we could just like repeat our names, give a little bit of background, like on our development or, like, what are, you know, are sort of weird perspective on the world that we bring to development, how we got introduced to Vue and how we've used Vue, like, in our in our day to day. How does that sound? Yeah, I say...\n\n\\[00:02:10] Ben: Let's let's knock them off one by one.\n\n\\[00:02:12] Chris: Beautiful. So, Benjamin, would you like to start?\n\n\\[00:02:16] Ben: All right, let's start with the first one. As far as my dev background, I actually have a masters in industrial organizational psychology. And so my beginning of development was back in the AOL days where I basically did stuff with a HTML CSS, on like Xanga, MySpace, but I thought that javascript, you needed to know Java to learn Javascript, and frankly, there was no one in my family to tell me otherwise. And so I failed pretty miserably and for many years had that misconception. And so it was until after grad school that I basically thought I wanted to get into user experience and then sort of with psychology, user experienc,e and remembering sort of the love of coding back when I was a kid, sort of put them all together, and that's how I got into the dev track. Ari, passing the ball to you. \n\nChris: Awesome.\n\n\\[00:02:59] Ari: Rude. Okay, fine. Ah, yes. So, I'm Ari Clark. My background is Iâ€™m a college dropout. Then I did nothing for several years in my twenties. Okay, basically all of my twenties. And then when I was, just after I turned 30 I started at a coding boot camp, and that changed my life. And then after the boot camp, I got a job at a company called Liqid, and I have been there ever since. So that's, like, two and 1/2 years now.\n\n\\[00:03:28] Chris: Yeah, and at Liqid you basically like build supercomputers with your mind. I understand.\n\n\\[00:03:32] Ari: Yeah, but I mean, I couldn't do it without Vue. So I do it with my mind and Vue.\n\n\\[00:03:38] Chris: Yeah, yeah. I mean, you, like, put out a little like keystrokes through your mind powers that, like, we all have telekinesis over like, certain body parts. \n\n\\[00:03:51] Ari: Yeah, And then Vue, like, communicates with the API, which communicates with the... Anyway, You get the idea. Yeah, mind powers. All right, Elizabeth.\n\n\\[00:04:00] Elizabeth: Thanks, Ari. So, yeah, I have, ah, relatively unrelated background to the stuff that I do now. So I studied drawing and painting in college. I have a masters in philosophy. And after college, I also kind of just did random stuff for a while. A couple of years, I was a copywriter/marketing person, sort of. And then I ended up moving to Australia and had a couple of extra months of, like, not having anything to do. So I had been studying JavaScript and CSS and stuff for quite a few months before then. And so when I get went, Australia put it into high gear, and I just learned, like, I don't know, basic website technology from mainly free code camp, I would say, was my main resource. And then I put together a little portfolio for myself and got a job at a digital agency where I started by knowing nothing and learned a whole lot was there just working a variety of different projects, mainly building websites with, like, jQuery and stuff. Then, towards the end, we started getting into using Vue. And then I moved back to United States. And now I use Vue all the time, day to day, just building websites. So that brings me to now. So, yeah, I'm just a every day Vue developer with interest more on the design side of things. And I really like creative frontend development.\n\n\\[00:05:28] Ari: Wow, I just learned a lot about you that I did not previously know. I had no idea you had a masters in philosophy. That's awesome!\n\n\\[00:05:34] Chris: Yes. I've always wanted to ask. To be or not to be. What is the answer to that one?\n\n\\[00:05:44] Elizabeth: Donâ€™t be.\n\n\\[00:05:46] Chris: Yeah, I guess we'll all be mostly not being, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I, for most of the time of history I have not been. And someday I will also not be, and then that will continue indefinitely.\n\n\\[00:06:03] Ari: Well, tell us more about that, Chris. It's your turn.\n\n\\[00:06:06] Chris: Okay, So I'm gonna tell you about the brief period in history where I have been. So I was born on a cold, stormy night and fast forward a little bit. I'm basically ah, like a theater nerd who, like, went into education. And I used to teach, like, human languages like like German, mostly German, like some Spanish and stuff like that, too. And then I started getting into web development to help me build the tools that, like I wanted as an educator that didn't exist yet. And then I found that, like, â€œHey, this, like web development stuff is pretty cool, too.â€\x9D And I started teaching more Web development. And so, I don't know if a lot of people know this, like itâ€™s, but like, teachers don't make a lot of money. So I would start doing, like, tech contracting work to fund a lot of my education work. And I'm still doing that today. And yeah, now, like Iâ€™m on the Vue team and helping work on that Vue and building cool stuff with Vue and like working with, ah, a lot of companies around the world. To help them build cool stuff with Vue too. And soon with Vue 3 *ba-dum-tss*.\n\n\\[00:07:20] Ari: Wow... Also, you felt like the most important thing that people will be familiar with your work. How did you get started on the Vue team like, what was your primary responsibility when you first started?\n\n\\[00:07:35] Chris: Well, actually, when I first started, it was just like complaining about documentation and things that I was experiencing that like, I wanted to fix, then trying to fix those things. Yeah, So I basically I write a lot of documentation for Vue and we have, like, a great team now, like with Sarah Drasner, Natalia Tepluhina, Phan An, doing like tremendous, tremendous work, like building great documentation. We have hundreds and hundreds of contributors. Natalia told me that, like recently, that she checked, and out of all the Vue repositories we have the most contributors, like unique contributors on Vue, or on like Vuejs.org, the doc site, which is really, really cool.\n\n\\[00:08:23] Ari: That's cool. I didn't know that.\n\n\\[00:08:24] Chris: So thank all of you in the community who have who have helped make the docs really great.\n\n\\[00:08:30] Ari: Thank all of Vue. Sorry, the pun had to be there.\n\n\\[00:08:38] Chris: That's that's good. This is, so something, this is actually a good segue, because our vision for the show, that's what we're gonna go into next. And one of our visions for the show is certainly lots of puns. I mean the title of the show is a pun: Enjoy the Vue. They're just gonna keep going from here. If you don't like puns, stop listening now, probably, because they're gonna keep coming.\n\n\\[00:09:01] Ari: But also, I would say another part of our vision for the show is that we would love it to be for the community, also by the community. So we will, at some point have a place where you can go to suggest topics and stuff. Yeah, I'm gonna let someone else take over because I'm just gonna go off the rails.\n\n\\[00:09:20] Chris: Yeah, So if people do you want to do that, like the place to do tt will be at enjoythevue.io. Right, Ben? Elizabeth?\n\n\\[00:09:29] Ben: That's right.\n\n\\[00:09:30] Elizabeth: That is correct.\n\n\\[00:09:31] Chris: Cool. As you can see, Ben and Elizabeth have been doing the majority of the work on that. \n\n\\[00:09:40] Ben: You find any bugs you can file issues on GitHub.\n\n\\[00:09:42] Elizabeth: or just keep it to yourself\n\n\\[00:09:46] Chris: Keep it to yourself? What? Why would you do that? Help us make it better.\n\n\\[00:09:51] Ben: Issue PRs. We love PRs.\n\n\\[00:09:53] Chris: Well, I mean, since you're in charge of the website, you can delegate to Ari and I as well. We can be your peons.\n\n\\[00:10:01] Elizabeth: I don't want to know about any bugs.\n\n\\[00:10:04] Chris: Okay, well, I would like to know about the bugs.\n\n\\[00:10:06] Elizabeth: I'm just kidding. I need to know about the bugs.\n\n\\[00:10:10] Chris: Yeah, Elizabeth's been having a hard week, I think. So, let's talk about the kinds of episodes we want to do for the show. And, Ari, you've been talking a lot about this. Would you like to go into some detail?\n\n\\[00:10:27] Ari: Ah, way to call me out. Okay, Yes. I think that it would be wonderful if we had lots of panel discussions which, if you're familiar with our previous podcast, those were sprinkled in there, usually when people canceled on us, but would like to do it more intentionally this time. And also continue to do guest interviews because we love people out in the community and we love learning about what they're doing. Also, just like common issues that we all face as Vue developers or really, just developers in general. We'd love to explore more libraries in the ecosystem. I dunno about y'all, but I don't really don't reach for libraries. I like to reinvent the wheel. And I should probably stop doing that because it wastes a lot of time.\n\n\\[00:11:11] Chris: Word. But yeah, I can waste a lot of time also doing research. So, like, you know, like, uh, it is really useful.\n\n\\[00:11:19] Ari: Someone else can take over.\n\n\\[00:11:22] Chris: Yeah, Ben, go ahead. Yeah. What else do you want to do on the show? Like, what can people expect?\n\n\\[00:11:29] Ben: Yeah, Ari covered a lot of things we've been talking about. We also want to cover things that are near and dear to sort of our lives as developers. So not necessarily Vue specific. But if you listened to the last show, we did things like, you know, mental health days, sort of talking about things that developers encounter, you know, on the day to day And how getting over those hurdles, whether it's imposter syndrome and those sort of things, you can expect to hear some episodes about those kinds of things as well.\n\n\\[00:11:52] Ari: And like we said, if you guys have specific ideas, please let us know because we want this to be for you guys. Not just what we want to do all the time. I mean, sometimes we're gonna be, like, â€œscrew you. Do what I want.â€\x9D Just kidding. Okay, we might do that sometimes. But for the most part, we want it to be about you all.\n\n\\[00:12:11] Chris: Yeah, for sure. If if people are saying, like, you know, sending in a lot of messages saying, you know, we'd love to hear you talk more about your pets, just, like, follow us on Twitter. But really, like, if if there are things and you would like to hear, like from a certain kind of guest, for example, you know, send those things in, too. We'd love to hear your feedback.\n\n\\[00:12:34] Ari: So if you want to tell us what you don't like, do that too, our feelings won't be hurt.\n\n\\[00:12:40] Chris: Yeah, but don't tell Elizabeth.\n\n\\[00:12:43] Elizabeth: Just tweet it at Ari.\n\n\\[00:12:43] Chris: @AriClark\n\n\\[00:12:47] Ari: Actually, it's @GloomyLumi.\n\n\\[00:12:49] Chris: you're right. Yeah, you're right. That's, L U M I, right?\n\n\\[00:12:55] Ari: Yes, it is. \n\n\\[00:12:58] Elizabeth: Yeah. What is that a reference to?\n\n\\[00:13:00] Ari: Itâ€™s actually reference to my gamer tag back when I was a gamer. Yeah, but also a reference to the types of stories I tell.\n\n\\[00:13:10] Chris: Yeah. Used to be like a pro gamer, werenâ€™t you?\n\n\\[00:13:13] Ari: Yeah, I was, uh, what is that? US top 100 ranked reading team in\n\n\\[00:13:19] Chris: no big deal. \n\n\\[00:13:20] Ari: World of Warcraft. Yeah.\n\n\\[00:13:22] Elizabeth: Are you serious? \n\n\\[00:13:23] Ari: Yeah, dead serious. Yeah.\n\n\\[00:13:24] Elizabeth: Youâ€™re kidding me. Thatâ€™s amazing!\n\n\\[00:13:26] Ari: I think last kill I actually got was, uh, U.S. 89th. And then they told me I wasn't good enough to play with them anymore. So talk about imposter syndrome come true. \n\n\\[00:13:36] Elizabeth: Wow. \n\n\\[00:13:37] Ari: And that was what I stopped playing. But I don't know that I'd be a coder today if that hadn't happened. So it all worked out.\n\n\\[00:13:45] Chris: Yeah. I think it's okay to not be able to keep up with people who are spending, like, 20 hours a day playing World of Warcraft.\n\n\\[00:13:51] Ari: Yeah, like I also,\n\n\\[00:13:53] Chris: it's okay to have more balance priorities\n\n\\[00:13:55] Ari: Yeah, like that was really what it came down to was like I just didnâ€™t--I wasn't spending the time required anymore.\n\n\\[00:14:02] Chris: Like you were getting--you were getting healthier. And\n\n\\[00:14:05] Ari: Yeah, exactly I was having I was having a real life. Thatâ€™s not to discount any of the people I played with cause a lot of them were just amazing people who somehow got everything done: had a life, raided, researched, but I am not the person who could do that. But actually so fun fact: You can still find some clips on twitch, twitch.tv/gloomylumi. So if you want to see how I used to play, there they are. But anyway yeah, totally off topic. Sorry.\n\n\\[00:14:32] Chris: No, that's great. Well, it's funny how, like a lot of us are learning new things about each other today.\n\n\\[00:14:36] Ari: I know! I actually really like this.\n\n\\[00:14:38] Chris: Even though we've known each other for quite some time.\n\n\\[00:14:40] Ari: I know, but like we usually you're talking like more vue-centric things and not so much about ourselves.\n\n\\[00:14:46] Chris: Yeah, so this is gonna be a pretty short episode. That's that's basically the idea we have for the show. And the way we want to wrap this up is with picks, you know like usual, the picks, for people who aren't familiar with it are just like things that we've been interested in that may or may not have anything to do with development or Vue that are just, like, pretty cool, maybe you should check out. And before we do that, I'd like to go around and just tell people where they can find more information about the show and also more information about us. So, Ben, actually, Elizabeth, Iâ€™m gonna do Elizabeth, Where can people find out, like, more information about the show? Do we have, like, a Twitter account or something? Are we on Insta? Are we on Tic Toc?\n\n\\[00:15:30] Elizabeth: Uh, wait, uh, we're not on tic toc yet. But youâ€™d be the best person to start that for us.\n\n\\[00:15:40] Chris: Me? No, no, no, no, no. I just learned literally yesterday at a party that tic toc is not a to do app. I was confusing it with tick tick. Wow. It's like these kids are really into this to do app, like I've heard good things. So I just seemed seemed weird to me. And then I once I learned that information, I had to, like, go back in my memory to see how many times I had possibly embarrassed myself.\n\n\\[00:16:10] Elizabeth: Itâ€™s okay. I don't think anyone really knows what Tic Tac is in. I\n\n\\[00:16:16] Chris: Isnâ€™t it like Vine?\n\n\\[00:16:18] Ben: I might know more about that than I should.\n\n\\[00:16:21] Elizabeth: I barely knew about it until, like, last week, and I feel like it makes everybody feel really, really old. I thought it was just Vine. I don't understand the difference.\n\n\\[00:16:30] Ben: Itâ€™s basically Vine. It's Vine. \n\n\\[00:16:33] Chris: Well Vine shut down. Yeah.\n\n\\[00:16:35] Ben: Viral short videos, basically. And then basically, because busy all these kids have smartphones now, they've learned some really innovative ways to play with trick photography.\n\n\\[00:16:42] Chris: All these kids have smart phones now. Oh, my gosh, Ben. You could not sound more like an old man. All these young in's like you think you are running around with their smartphones and that gadgets and that fidget spinners and their pogs.\n\n\\[00:17:04] Ari: Okay, harkening back to my youth. \n\n\\[00:17:12] Chris: And the Pokemons!\n\n\\[00:17:14] Ari: Iâ€™m too old for that, thank you.\n\n\\[00:17:18] Ben: That's still cool, alright.\n\n\\[00:17:16] Ari: Yeah, Ben.\n\n\\[00:17:21] Elizabeth: So our tic toc account is forthcoming. As soon as Chris learns the dances. Our Twitter account is--\n\n\\[00:17:37] Chris: Okay. I need so much more research. Our Twitter account is--we were trying to do this for, like, five minutes. Go ahead.\n\n\\[00:17:44] Elizabeth: It's @enjoythevuecast. Vue spelled V U E, obviously.\n\n\\[00:17:51] Ari: It would have been bad if we spelled it the other way.\n\n\\[00:17:52] Chris: Maybe we should have that one too and redirect. Is that possible on Twitter?\n\n\\[00:18:01] Ari: I donâ€™t think so. That would be awesome if it was.\n\n\\[00:18:04] Ben: You have to just like, camp it and then give a link. \n\n\\[00:18:07] Chris: Yeah, let's camp it. Don't follow us on that one. \n\n\\[00:18:10] Ari: Yeah, 'cause we don't have that one yet. \n\n\\[00:18:07] Chris: Yeah, well, we will, probably by the time this comes out\n\n\\[00:18:18] Elizabeth: and our Insta is @Enjoytheviewpodcast.\n\n\\[00:18:23] Chris: Wait @enjoythevuecast on Twitter and @Enjoytheviewpodcast on Insta? Ben, you literally only had 20 jobs.\n\n\\[00:18:39] Ari: Itâ€™s true. I guess we should go easy on him.\n\n\\[00:18:41] Ben: Itâ€™s not my fault. Twitter had a character limit on the user name, apparently. That's why we got stuck with that.\n\n\\[00:18:46] Ari: I guess we're gonna have to maybe also get @enjoythevuecast on Insta. \n\n\\[00:18:51] Chris: Yeah, let's get @enjoythevuecast on Insta and let's keep it consistent. Yeah, but don't follow us on podcast. Yeah. @enjoythevuecast everywhere.\n\n\\[00:19:02] Ben: All right. Except for our website, which is enjoythevue.io. Branding is fun.\n\n\\[00:19:09] Chris: And then where can people find us individually? Just on Twitter. We don't need to go into Insta or the Tic Tocs.\n\n\\[00:19:16] Ari: I think we already went over mine, in depth.\n\n\\[00:19:18] Elizabeth: Oh, yes, Gloomy Lumi. And mine is @Elizabethfine4, like number four.\n\n\\[00:19:25] Ben: And mine is @bencodezen.\n\n\\[00:19:26] Ari: Everywhere.\n\n\\[00:19:27] Chris: But I want people to know like ElizabethFine2 is also a great follow. She's so funny. Yeah, it's It's great,\n\n\\[00:19:39] Elizabeth: actually, ElizabethFine2 is suspended. I just checked. I donâ€™t what she did, but it was bad.\n\n\\[00:19:52] Ari: Wow, Chris. You were really going out on the limb there, because what if she was, like, a racist or something?\n\n\\[00:19:56] Chris: You're right. I shouldn't have. \n\n\\[00:19:59] Ari: Which, I mean, it sounds like she might have been.\n\n\\[00:20:02] Chris: Yeah, maybe. Okay, well, ElizabethFine4 is the only one I can vouch for. Follow other Elizabeth Fines at your own risk.\n\n\\[00:20:12] Ari: ElizabethFine4 is the best Elizabeth Fine. So.\n\n\\[00:20:16] Chris: and Benjamin Hong, where can people find you?\n\n\\[00:20:20] Ari: BenCodeZen everywhere.\n\n\\[00:20:21] Ben: Yes, BenCodeZen everywhere.\n\n\\[00:20:23] Ari: So it's just you now, Chris.\n\n\\[00:20:24] Chris: Ends in dot io at BenCodeZen. So I'm Chris. I'm Chris V. Fritz. On GitHub and Twitter, everywhere.\n\n\\[00:20:34] Ben: And the V is for Vue. That's your middle name, right?\n\n\\[00:20:37] Chris: No. My middle name is not Vue. My parents were not looking that far ahead.\n\n\\[00:20:44] Ari: Wouldâ€™ve been amazing if they had.\n\n\\[00:20:46] Chris: no, we will. We will reveal my middle name on our final episode. So stay tuned if you care. Spoiler alert: it'll be totally underwhelming. And you can You can send your guesses to @gloomylumi. And the people who guess it correctly will not win a prize.\n\n\\[00:21:11] Ben: Well, speaking of prizes, should we start doing picks?\n\n\\[00:21:13] Chris: Let's do picks. I don't know what the speaking of prizes thing is, that was an attemp at a segue, I guess. \n\n\\[00:21:20] Ari: Wow. Rude. \n\n\\[00:21:24] Chris:  Well, none of our picks are prizes. Sorry about that. prizes. \n\n\\[00:21:28] Ari: Uh, they could be. We are giving them gifts of knowledge.\n\n\\[00:21:32] Chris: Okay, So, Ben, would you like to start with your pick?\n\n\\[00:21:38] Ben: Yeah, so I got one pick for this week. And so I started watching this Netflix documentary called Taco Chronicles, which basically is shot in Mexico. And it takes, like, different types of tacos, like the Al Pastora, the carne Asada, and goes into, like the history behind each one and the culinary like behind it. How its cultural influence--and yes, super great while you're eating food, I like to watch it. So it's all done in Spanish. If anyone's learning Spanish, you can practice your Spanish while listening to it.\n\n\\[00:22:07] Ari: So you say if you're hungry, maybe not a good show to watch.\n\n\\[00:22:10] Ben: Yes.\n\n\\[00:22:11] Chris: It sounds like a show that you should be eating food during or else you could be eating food soon after.\n\n\\[00:22:19] Ben: Was that not clear about that? Yes. I eat my food while I watched the Taco Chronicles. And I wish my food was tacos.\n\n\\[00:22:26] Ari: Why don't you just eat tacos while watching it?\n\n\\[00:22:29] Chris: That's that's an achievable dream, Ben.\n\n\\[00:22:34] Ben: I donâ€™t know. I need to find a good taqueria nearby. I just moved here.\n\n\\[00:22:37] Chris: Okay. Uh, Elizabeth, you want to go next?\n\n\\[00:22:40] Elizabeth: Sure. So my pick is an app called Todoist. And someone recommended it to me recently, and they were like, â€œThis is the most amazing app ever. I'm getting so much done. I've completed so many tasks.â€\x9D So I give it a try, and I really like it so far. I mean, it's really nice UI lets you categorize your tasks into different groups and categorize them by different days. So I feel like it's helping my productivity. \n\n\\[00:23:02] Chris: Thatâ€™s what I use, too.\n\n\\[00:23:04] Ben: I thought you used Tick Tick.\n\n\\[00:23:05] Elizabeth: You use it too?\n\n\\[00:23:02] Chris: Mhmm.\n\n\\[00:23:07] Elizabeth: not Tick Tick, Todoist.\n\n\\[00:23:09] Chris: No, I don't use tick tick. \n\n\\[00:23:11] Elizabeth: Not TicToc?\n\n\\[00:23:13] Chris: I like to manage my todos on TicToc. I just send myself seven second videos. Okay, Ari, would you like to go next?\n\n\\[00:23:24] Ari: Sure. Okay, so I'm gonna preface this with I hate exercising with a passion. Like I just itâ€™s just not my jam. But I recently figured out the one thing that will make me exercise: And that's if you gamify it. So Nintendo Switch has Ring Fit Adventure. And I have actually been consistently working out 5 to 6 days a week for, like, 45 minutes a day. This has literally never happened in my life. And I look forward to it every day. Like, I don't even know who I am anymore. But yeah, if you're like me and you're like, you find exercise kind of boring in general. I just donâ€™t like doing it. Iâ€™m just like, â€œOh my god, I want to be doing something else.â€\x9D I highly recommend Ring Fit Adventure. Also, it's really like it's actually a really good workout. I've been extremely sore, so yeah, that is my pick.\n\n\\[00:24:14] Chris: Gosh, this has been making a lot more sense now. Like for people who can't see the video. I mean, because this is an audio medium. People, Ari has actually been lifting, I think like 300 pounds over her head the entire podcast, not even breaking a sweat. And it seemed like a weird flex to me, but yeah,\n\n\\[00:24:36] Ben: Yeah, weird flex, but okay.\n\n\\[00:24:37] Ari: I guess that brings us to Chris. What's your pick?\n\n\\[00:24:41] Chris: My pick is Stardew Valley--which I've talked about on the previous show, Views on Vue, before--is a game that I am no longer allowed to play because I have problems with self control with Stardew Valley. But they recently came out with an update, update 1.4, and it seems like it seems like it's really cool it. It's called the Everything update, and it basically touches everything about the game and, like, refines it, adds more content, tons and tons of content. Like the release notes, I actually couldn't finish because it was too much. Like there's so many things in there and it just looks awesome. And I regret that I will never be able to play it. But if you play it and you have more self control than me, I would love to hear what you think and you can, for that one, You can at me @GloomyLumi, or @ChrisVFritz.\n\n\\[00:25:40] Ari: Wow, so I'm glad that you called that out because I also have no self control. However, I still let myself play it. So thanks for ruining my life, Chris.\n\n\\[00:25:50] Chris: We are obligated to tell you we're not responsible for any time that you spend playing video games instead of engaging in social activities or doing your work. We're not responsible for you getting fired for no0t doing your work.\n\n\\[00:26:04] Ari: Especially since we have a tendency to pick a lot of games.\n\n\\[00:26:05] Ben: We do.\n\n\\[00:26:06] Chris: And also people like exercising, like Ari's pick, Yeah, I've said this before, but Beat Saber is a great VR game where you can just, like, take light sabers and hit blocks like a jedi. I like to think that's how jedi stay fit. It's like DDR for jedis.\n\n\\[00:26:26] Ben: when I had the honor of watching Chris play. Actually, recently, he does it with a lot of flair. Maybe we'll make a tic toc video out of that, when youâ€™re playing Best Saber.\n\n\\[00:26:33] Chris: Sure, Uh, eventually, I think we've talked about, like, starting starting a Patreon and we can have one of the stretch goals, a tic toc of me playing Beat saber. And then once we reach that goal, people will immediately withdraw all that money just to ensure that we never like, they never ever have to see that again. Okay, so that's it for today. Thank you, everyone for enjoying us on her new show. Enjoy the Vue. And until next time, \n\n\\[00:27:00] Ari: Enjoy the Vue! \n\n*Outro Music*\n\nSponsor Ad:\n\n\\[00:27:10] Ben: This podcast is brought to you by our friends at Linode.
