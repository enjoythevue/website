shownotes: >-
  The focus of today's show is the divisive topic of CSS. There are many
  different opinions on the strengths, weaknesses, and value of CSS, and to
  explore this in some detail, we are lucky enough to have Josh Comeau join us
  on our extended panel! One of the strongest messages that comes through from
  our discussion is the amount of time and effort that CSS requires you to
  invest, to reap its benefits. And while not every developer will agree to this
  exchange, it is hard to argue that certain parts of CSS can make this a
  worthwhile endeavor. We talk about the ever-increasing complexity of CSS and
  how this has occurred over time as the language has been added to. We also get
  into our favorite parts and features, looking at variables, current color, and
  a whole lot more. So, to hear it all from our team and our great guest, Josh
  Comeau, be sure to listen in with us today, on Enjoy the Vue!

  “I started trying to really understand CSS. I really, really enjoy the language now. It's become probably my favorite part of doing web development.” — [@JoshWComeau](https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau) \[0:05:55]


  “I do think that right now is an incredibly exciting time to be a CSS person because so many amazing things are right on the horizon." — [@JoshWComeau](https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau) \[0:11:30]


  “That's what leads to that feeling that CSS is unpredictable and inconsistent. It's not. It's just that if you only have one of the puzzle pieces, of course, it's not going to seem consistent.” — [@JoshWComeau](https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau) \[0:40:29]
