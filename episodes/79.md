shownotes: >-
  Join us today as we talk to Ash Ryan Arnwine (developer experience leader for
  DataStax) about Getting Started Guides. Ash takes us through his experience
  with Vue, and how the guides in Vue 1 were the North Star for him when he was
  working with Adobe Creative Cloud. We discuss the challenges in migrating from
  different versions, and the downsides to Getting Started videos in place of
  text. Find out how keeping Ash's four-year-old daughter from sleeping is the
  highest praise the Vue team has received, and what each of the team feels is
  better: prescriptive or flexible guides. From picking the correct level to
  pitch your instructions at, to the different types of people defined as
  “developers”, you don’t want to miss out on this information-packed episode!
