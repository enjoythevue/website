  Welcome to Enjoy the Vue!  Today, we have the second part of the Meta episode
  of Enjoy the Vue.  We have VueNYC meetup organizers, Matt and Ringo joining
  us. Ringo is a web developer and helps with VueNYC Meetup.  Matt is one of the
  organizers of the Vue Meetup for VueNYC and also an amateur AV tech. In this
  episode the panelists answer questions from people in Slack Chat. Also, one of
  our panelists answers a question in a Batman voice! Download this episode now

  ## Outline

  [00:00:47] The live questions have started on Slack Chat, and the first
  question asked is what are your impressions of Vite and Vite Press?


  [00:01:49] Since Nuxt and the content module is stable, what kind of markdown
  editor do you suggest?


  [00:02:37] Speaking of projects, what projects do you think are best for
  Gridsome and what’s the most interactive type of site you might make with
  Gridsome?


  [00:03:46] It’s question three, so time for a promised Batman voice reveal☺. 
  For a progressive web app, where PWA, that would be largely used on a phone,
  how would you make the decision between making a Vue app versus a Nuxt app?
  Batman answers!


  [00:04:45] What’s your take on Vite and will it be the future where build time
  will be much lower?


  [00:05:41] Have any of you guys used GraphQL with Vue projects and what did
  you think of it?


  [00:08:55] Ben talks about composing requests.


  [00:11:56] What’s it like being on the Vuejs core team, what are the team’s
  workflows like, and how often does the team meet?


  [00:14:33] When writing software what is the best way to identify the design
  pattern that works best for your application and how do you go about coming up
  with the best way to structure the project?


  [00:25:52] For what kinds of projects would you suggest using Typescript? Is
  it only for big projects or can you also use it for smaller projects?
