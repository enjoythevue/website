  In this episode, we have two special guests, Jessica Sachs and Lachlan Miller,
  who both work on Vue Test Utils.  Jessica is the Staff Engineer at Intent and
  the maintainer of Vue Test Utils.  Lachlan Miller, from Australia, is a
  full-stack developer who specializes in Vue.js, React.js, and TypeScript. You
  will learn all about what they are doing with Vue Test Utils. Also, other
  topics include Mocking, Stubbing, Mount, Shallow Mount, and many other things.

  too.

  [00:00:49] Jessica and Lachlan give a brief introduction how they started
  working on Vue Test Utils.  


  [00:02:32] Jessica and Lachlan discuss working on a rewrite of Vue Test Utils
  in Type Script.


  [00:04:22] Find out what Lachlan says what’s a priority for them in the next
  version of Utils. Also, there is discussion of examples of things that Vue
  Test Utils wasn’t really built initially to help people test that they are now
  learning. 


  [00:07:35] For those who don’t have much background with testing, you can hear
  how Vue Test Utils fits in the larger scope of application and where does Vue
  Test Utils fit with Jest and Cypress. 


  [00:13:08] Mocking and Stubbing are explained as well as the difference
  between Mount and Shallow Mount. 


  [00:26:36] An important topic Lachlan discusses is documentation and what the
  team needs to focus on.


  [00:31:54] Jessica touches on one of the things they are hoping to address in
  documentation, and she spills out a couple of cool “SPOILERS!”


  [00:35:41] What is this talk about, “Imposter Syndrome?” It’s just human,
  let’s say. 


  [00:39:18] Jessica mentions things she built on Vue Test Utils before and
  things she’s trying to refine. 


  [00:44:32] Find out why Jessica has a “beef” with the existence of set props.


  [00:48:21] A question was asked what everyone’s main use of set props is, so
  listen to hear what they said.
