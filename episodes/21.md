  Welcome to Enjoy the Vue!  Today, we have a special Meta episode of Enjoy the
  Vue.  We have VueNYC meetup organizers, Matt and Ringo joining us. Ringo is a
  web developer and helps with VueNYC Meetup.  Matt is one of the organizers of
  the Vue Meetup for VueNYC and also an amateur AV tech. The panelists discuss
  what’s it’s like to run a podcast, what kind of podcasts they were listening
  to before coming on the show, and what inspired them to create their own
  podcast. They also discuss what their goals, challenges, and tips are to start
  a podcast.  


  ## Outline


  [00:01:23] We start off by talking about everyone’s general podcast
  experiences and what kind of podcasts everyone was listening to before they
  were on their own podcast. Also, what inspired them to create their own
  podcasts and what were their goals?     


  [00:15:59] The panelists talk about how the podcast has evolved over the
  years, episodes, months, or iterations.
   
  [00:24:14] Tessa asks the panelists if they listen to podcasts differently now
  that they’re on one pretty much every week? 


  [00:29:59] Ringo and Matt talk about how their podcasts listening habits have
  changed since they listen to a lot of podcasts.


  [00:32:30] The panelists share what their challenges have been in making the
  podcast.

  own podcast.
