shownotes: >-
  The role of developer advocate is a fairly new one and can therefore be
  difficult to define as it continues to evolve. In today’s episode, Alex,
  Tessa, and Ari get together with Debbie O’Brien, Head Developer Advocate at
  Bit, to discuss how she transitioned from being a developer to team leader to
  working as a developer advocate and she unpacks the elements that drew her to
  the role. Debbie shares her passionate take on KPIs as well as the lessons she
  learned from the book Surrounded by Idiots. We delve into the traits that make
  up a good developer advocate and discuss why there’s a need for companies to
  introduce the role of junior developer advocate. Later Debbie shares some of
  the learning challenges you’ll experience as a developer advocate and how she
  adapted to learning React under high-pressure circumstances. We end the show
  by hearing everybody’s picks, ranging from AI software and counterintuitive
  fruit gums to the world’s most expensive headphones. For all this and more,
  join us today!

  **Tweetables:**




  “Maybe the most successful model for a junior developer advocate program would be one at a company large enough that could have them do product rotations.” — [@GloomyLumi](https://twitter.com/gloomylumi?lang=en) \[0:35:23]




  “I feel like KPIs are kind of, it's that classic criticism of measuring something because it's measurable, rather than measuring the things that you need to keep track of like, it's just quantitative data.” — Tessa \[0:08:30]




  “I started thinking about what are the parts of my job that I love and what is the part of the job that I don't like, and then try and look at what kind of job fits the job that I love. And everything seemed to fit into developer advocate.” — [@debs_obrien](https://twitter.com/debs_obrien) \[0:40:54]




  “Having worked on small, medium, and large codebases, I know one of the big things that I think you need to keep in mind when you're doing developer advocacy is, ‘Okay, how do you integrate this with an already existing project?’” —[@fimion](https://twitter.com/fimion) \[0:32:58]




  “There should probably be a starter role, maybe it's not a junior developer advocate, maybe it's like a content creator and then you kind of go up because you could be a very, very, very good content creator, and not necessarily be a developer advocate.” — [@debs_obrien](https://twitter.com/debs_obrien) \[0:35:50]
