  Today on the Enjoy the Vue our team are joined by Eduardo San Martin Morote,
  to talk about pinia! We kick things off by discussing some general experiences
  using global stores in Vue and how pinia compares to these, before making some
  more direct comparisons with Vuex. Eduardo unpacks the role of pinia, and what
  inspired the project and making it available to the public. We also get into
  some discussion on server-side rendering, with Eduardo sharing his thoughts on
  making the work more automatic and convenient. We also get to hear from our
  guest about his thoughts on making the transition from a personal project into
  something open-source and available on GitHub. Towards the end of our chat,
  Eduardo offers some ideas about keeping a good work-life balance and swapping
  between passion projects and client work, before we round things up with some
  great picks from the world of books, games, and television!¬†¬†

  ‚ÄúI face the different problems. I face different teams, different application architectures. That's what I use. I use that knowledge to build the APIs that could work in all these scenarios.‚Äù ‚Äî [@posva](https://twitter.com/posva?lang=en) \[0:29:05]


  ‚ÄúI think, sometimes you also need to push the thing a little bit, because if you want to get more users, you need to announce things. You need to talk about the thing.‚Äù ‚Äî [@posva](https://twitter.com/posva?lang=en) \[0:36:03]
