  Today on our show, we have Amir Rustamzadeh.  He is Head of DX Engineering at
  Cypress. We will be talking with Amir all about testing. We go into end to end
  testing and what it’s all about. If you want something that speeds up your
  development, then you need to listen here.  The panelists all share their
  experiences with it as well. There are some really great picks of the week
  that you won’t want to miss. Let’s just say Chris trolled Ben on something and
  it made them all laugh! 


  [00:01:27] Ben jumps in right away and asks Amir when it comes to front end
  frameworks what was his first one and how did he come to join the Vue
  community?


  [00:03:46] Amir talks about how he’s heading up developer experience.  He
  announces Ben is on the team now! YAY BEN! ☺
   
  [00:05:07] Tessa wonders when Amir is going around to solve problems, does he
  find that a lot of teams have very different ways of looking at Cypress usage
  or end to end testing, and if so, how does he resolve that or try to work on
  this kind of experience that works for everyone?  


  [00:06:47] Chris and Amir explain what end to end testing is.  


  [00:13:23] Ben explains what end to end testing means to him and Chris talks
  about the two things that you need to test in your application. 


  [00:21:54] Amir talks about something he’s been advocating for recently that
  has to do with testing and developing apps, so listen here find out. He also
  explains “introspection.”
   
  [00:26:30] A great question is asked by Ari who wants to know what are some of
  the barriers to entry that people find that is making it so they’re not doing
  this and how can you address those issues?  Amir responds.  


  [00:29:04] Tessa asks Amir if he’s speaking to a team that has a setup
  already, where would he have them start or how would he convince them to adopt
  a different testing? 


  [00:38:31] Amir talks about what Cypress released in the recent version of
  Cypress 4.3 and 4.4, which is better error reporting that is significantly
  better. There are also some new improvements on the way as well.
