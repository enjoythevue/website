shownotes: >-
  With the release of Vue 3, developers now have access to the Composition API,
  a new way to write Vue components. This API allows features to be grouped
  together logically, rather than having to organize single-file components by
  function. Using the Composition API can lead to more readable code, and gives
  developers more flexibility and scalability when developing their
  applications, which signals a bright future for Vue. At least, this is what
  today’s guest believes! Today, we speak with Oscar Spencer, developer at
  Tidelift and co-author of the Grain programming language, about Vue’s
  Composition API and why he believes it represents great things for Vue. We
  touch on Options API, our opinions of a template-first approach, and why
  Composition API is infinitely better than Mixins, as well as how JavaScript
  can prepare developers for Options API and what to watch out for when you
  first start working with Composition API in Vue. All this plus this week’s
  picks and so much more when you tune in today!

  **Tweetables:**


  “When I look at the Composition API, I see a very bright future for Vue.” — [@oscar_spen](https://twitter.com/oscar_spen) \[0:02:22]


  “The Composition API just gets rid of a whole host of issues that you have with Mixins. In fact, Mixins were my only complaint in Vue 2.” — [@oscar_spen](https://twitter.com/oscar_spen) \[0:24:05]


  “Don’t be too scared of the \[Composition API]. It was definitely designed with composition in mind. It was designed for you to have your composables consuming composables and not blowing up the world – \[while] being fairly easy to follow as well.” — [@oscar_spen](https://twitter.com/oscar_spen) \[0:27:34]


  “Regular JavaScript modules only get you so far because, fundamentally, what these regular JavaScript modules are missing is the reactivity. What the Composition API is letting us do is compose things that are reactive.” — [@oscar_spen](https://twitter.com/oscar_spen) \[0:41:44]


  “By far the biggest gotcha with the Composition API is not understanding Vue's reactivity. That’s going to be the biggest gotcha that you can possibly run into. I highly recommend, instead of trying to wing it, just go look at a tutorial.” — [@oscar_spen](https://twitter.com/oscar_spen) \[0:57:02]
