  Welcome to Enjoy the Vue!  Today, our topic is all about VuePress. Ben has
  done a lot of work on VuePress and he’s on the VuePress Core Team, so he is
  going to be answering a lot of questions today from Chris and Tessa. We learn
  what VuePress is, how it started, and what the future holds. We also learn
  about what Hexo is and how Vite Press comes into play with the future of
  VuePress. If you want to learn more about VuePress and where to start,

  ## Outline

  [00:00:50] Ben tells us what VuePress is. 


  [00:01:43] Chris wants to know when he would use VuePress and if there’s some
  kind of enterprise boilerplate where someone could see an example of an
  integration with VuePress into a project.  
   
  [00:04:20] Chris wants to know how Vue Press started and what are its origins?


  [00:06:17] Chris and Ben tell us what Hexo is.  


  [00:07:36] Ben tells us what the future of VuePress holds and where is it
  going.


  [00:10:07] Tessa wonders how does flat structure work with scaffolding and the
  VuePress structure and she wonders how does VitePress come into play with
  regards to the future of VuePress?   


  [00:14:59] Tessa wonders if she wants to integrate VuePress into a React
  project or an Angular project, does she need to worry about having a certain
  file structure or will she be able to take advantage of that smart feature of
  Vue Press?


  [00:16:13] Going back to the idea of being able to include snippets from the
  code base in VuePress, Tessa feels like there’s some potential for overlap
  with them, something like Storybooks. She is wondering how you divide the
  responsibilities between two tools like that.


  [00:20:17] Chris wants to know if there’s anything else in the future of
  VuePress that Ben is thinking of or someone else is thinking of something that
  may or may not even make it into VuePress but it’s a twinkle in someone’s eye?
  ☺


  [00:21:48] Chris has two final questions for Ben. Does VuePress use VuePress
  for its docs and if people want to learn more about VuePress where do they
  start?
