  Imagine working on projects that last for two weeks or less. This is what
  today’s guest, Jason Etcovich, gets to do all the time! Jason is a Senior
  Software Engineer at GitHub, where he is part of the Special Projects team. He
  is also involved in the Paper Cuts project, which works directly with the
  community to fix small to medium workflow problems. In this episode, Jason
  sheds light on how he became a software engineer having come from a design
  background. While this may sound like a drastic shift, it was gradual, which
  made the transition smoother. We talk about some of the exciting happenings at
  GitHub, like GitHub Pilot, Paper Cut, and Codespaces, and what these projects
  will offer the community. Our conversation also touches on automation and
  where it goes right and wrong, how to use software to make our lives better,
  and as usual, we get into some classic developer debates. Tune in to hear it
  all.

  “Part of learning that design mindset is understanding like, how does a person approach this thing? What are the various touch points that they have to consider?” — [@JasonEtco](https://twitter.com/jasonetco?lang=en) \[0:10:03]


  “How do you say like, ‘Oh, yes. This is important,” If you don't have the data to back it up.” How do you get the data to back it up, if you don't prioritize that project? Where in that loop does it fit to get all of that data?” — [@JasonEtco](https://twitter.com/jasonetco?lang=en) \[0:19:57]


  “If you build your automation tool in an inflexible way, you'll really regret it later.” — [@JasonEtco](https://twitter.com/jasonetco?lang=en) \[0:27:13]
