  Welcome to Enjoy the Vue!  In today’s episode we are going to chat about what
  it’s like to learn new things and development challenges that can come with
  keeping up with the latest and greatest. We will talk about comments, context,
  and conference talks. We will also discuss language in writing code and how it
  can be frustrating at times. Ari, Tessa, and Ben all share some great stories
  and advice. Have you heard of “Onion skinning?” Download this episode to find
  out what it is and much more! 


  ## Outline

  [00:00:50] Ben starts things out by telling us he’s always trying to hack on
  new technology methods and trying to keep up with new libraries getting
  released, so he asks Ari and Tessa what would be their first instinct to learn
  about Vue 3 Teleport? Tessa’s answer is the BEST! 


  [00:04:31] The topics of comments, context, and conference talks are discussed
  here.    
   
  [00:11:00] Ben asks Ari when she starts getting into the deeper level things,
  the written piece, what are some things she finds that have been helpful or
  things that have not worked when she reads blog posts or those kinds of
  things? Tessa has some things to share as well.  


  [00:18:40] Ben asks Ari and Tessa when it comes to learning new things, are
  there things that they have come across, whether it’s writing styles or talks
  and are there things that get in the way of your learning?


  [00:24:00] Tessa brings up something in animation called “Onion skinning” and
  she explains what it does. Ben talks about writing and how it’s a difficult
  skill which most people don’t have a lot of training in. 


  [00:27:57] The panelists all discuss language in writing code and how the
  intent is to make something less intimidating, but it frustrates people
  sometimes.


  [00:33:01] Tessa tells us a great story here about some advice she got from a
  product manager she met. Ben also has a great story and advice to share. 


  [00:38:35] Tessa mentions Linux and included language and how it is hard to
  figure out how to sign up for it, but there is a website that will help you
  which is linked below. 


  [00:39:15] Tessa talks about learning journeys and how everybody’s situation
  is slightly different. Ari mentions how it’s a very important skill being able
  to teach a concept as well as to be able to give constructive feedback.
