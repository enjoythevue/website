  #### Show Notes

  [00:01:00] Chris gets right into business and explains what Vue Devtools are. 


  [00:05:51] Ben explains the “EventBus” in Devtools and what kinds of events it
  tracks.


  [00:06:47] Ari talks about the “Vuex tabs” since that’s the tab she spends the
  most time in.  There are two panels that she explains about. 


  [00:12:07] Chris blows everyone’s mind by telling them a feature that a lot of
  people don’t know about by clicking on the components tree and inspecting.
  Listen here to have your mind blown! It’s a game changer! 


  [00:18:39] Ben explains a “console log” trick he’s learned recently if you
  ever have trouble unpacking an object. This trick he talks about allows you to
  do it in a dropdown manner. 


  [00:21:34] Chris asks everyone what kinds of tricks or tools they use when
  they are troubleshooting by themselves. 


  [00:28:07] Tessa mentions something pretty cool and useful about how you can
  activate Vue Devtools on the production version of a website.
