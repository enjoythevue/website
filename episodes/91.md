  “I've been writing Vue forever. I think the reason I chose it is just because at this point, it's boring and it's easy and I have all the problems solved already.” — [@jakecodes](https://twitter.com/jakecodes?lang=en) \[0:05:47]


  “If you had a choice between a lawnmower, React, Vue, Svelt, and an electric skateboard, choose Vue.js.” — [@jakecodes](https://twitter.com/jakecodes?lang=en) \[0:36:03]


  “I want to learn all the programming languages, even if it's like, nobody uses them. It's like talking to a bunch of different people.” — [@jakecodes](https://twitter.com/jakecodes?lang=en) \[0:47:24]


  “If you're going to build a game from scratch and you can always do whatever the hell you want, you can just technically put something in C++ and then have something in Vue.” — [@jakecodes](https://twitter.com/jakecodes?lang=en) \[0:54:44]
