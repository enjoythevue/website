  The theme of this episode is EDUCATION. We have special guest, Hope Wilder,
  the Founder of Pathfinder Community School, which is a self-directed learning
  community for ages 5-14, located in Durham, North Carolina. They focus on
  self-directed education and applying principles with children.  Remember these
  catchphrases: Is it good enough for now? Is it safe to try? Those who do the
  work decide. 


  [00:01:13] Chris starts off and talks about his background as an educator and
  voiced his opinions on the traditional education systems.  


  [00:04:21] Hope discusses how she got into education and founding a school.
  The more she worked with kids, the more she saw that forcing kids to learn
  things just doesn’t really work.  


  [00:06:08] Hope explains what it means for it to be a democratic school and
  how it’s a very systems level of approach.


  [00:11:22] How do the kids learn skills such as conflict resolution and being
  responsible for getting their work done when working in groups? 


  [00:15:41] Ari wonders if Hope provides any sort of suggestions, guidance, or
  options for the kids to work from or if it’s very much from their own
  imaginations and personal motives. 


  [00:19:36] Chris brings up finding your own resources and how a former student
  at Pathfinder, now co-works at a tech company and he’s only 15 years old!


  [00:23:08] Ben asks both Chris and Hope about how they feel that self-directed
  learning relates to development in the Open Source community as far as the
  relationship between them and how we can learn from that. 


  [00:28:00] Hope discusses sociocracy which is a form of democracy. There are
  two important principles or catchphrases that they use a lot at the school. 


  [00:41:12] Chris gives his thoughts on bootcamps vs self-taught.


  [00:49:09] Hope reveals why she created Pathfinder, which was a part of
  self-healing. 


  [00:57:26] Hope mentions some resources people can dig into if they are
  looking into self-directed learning for their kids. She gives MANY, so
  listen. 


  Picks of the week:

  [01:01:02] Ben’s pick is a book called, “Essentialism” by Greg McKeown. 

  [01:01:54] Chris’s pick is to check out self-directed education, like
  Pathfinder.

  [01:03:18] Hope has two picks: “Outlander” on Netflix and a blog called “Post
  Secret.”

  [01:06:38] Ari has three picks: two songs by music group “Moderat,” called, “A
  New Error” and “Les Grandes Marches.” The third is a TV show on HULU called,
  “Community.”
