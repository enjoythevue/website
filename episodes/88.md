  There are very few barriers keeping you from creating the career you want.
  For many developers, formal education no longer matters. What matters is
  demonstrating your skill and your dedication to the craft you’ve chosen to
  pursue. When you learn in public, you do just that; you share your skill
  development and your work in progress online. Originally from Lagos, Nigeria,
  today’s guest is a frontend developer, content creator, speaker, and
  conference contributor who advocates for the benefits of learning in public.
  Gift Egwuenu relocated to the Netherlands in 2020 to begin her journey as a
  Frontend Engineer at Passionate People, a Javascript-focused consultancy based
  in Amsterdam. Since then, Gift has gained experience working in various
  environments, with various people, and in a multitude of frameworks and, in
  today’s episode, she shares some of the pros and cons of learning in public
  and what it means, from sharing what you’re learning on Twitter to creating
  video tutorials and live streams. We touch on the concept of conference-driven
  development, self-motivated learning versus audience-driven content, and
  work-life balance, and we share some of our favorite resources and suggestions
  for getting started on your learning in public journey! For all this and so
  much more, including our weekly picks (of course!), make sure not to miss this

  “A lot of people \\[think], ‘Why would I come out and publicly humiliate
  myself? Because this is not something that I'm an expert in.’ They shy away
  from doing it, but I like to advocate for \\[public learning], because of the
  benefits that it comes with.” — [@lauragift_](https://twitter.com/lauragift_)

  “Job opportunities, getting access to mentors, or just people helping you
  out is another benefit you get out of \\[public learning].” —

  “The most important thing is to have fun with it. No one’s sponsoring you.
  No one’s paying you to do it. If you're just doing it for the heck of it, have
  fun with it. Learn however you want to learn. Don't let anybody get you down.”

  “Feel free to ask questions. Feel free to make mistakes. That's definitely
  the idea of \\[public learning] in the first place. You're not perfect, so you
  learn stuff, break stuff, and then you get better at it.” —
